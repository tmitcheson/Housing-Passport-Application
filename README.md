# Housing Passport Application

The Housing Passport application is a Proof-Of-Concept for a Building Renovation Passport. It combines structural property data found on the EPC database with personal consumption records from Octopus Energy smart meters and returns information and recommendations to the user based on a synthesis of the two.

The majority of the web application is built using NextJS and is hosted on Vercel. The back end functionality, and most of the database interactivity, is written in Python for a Flask app hosted on Heroku.

The corresponding web application for this code repository can be found at: https://housing-passport-app.vercel.app/
